# Group Sorter
A program that suggests diverse groups based on attribute scores. This was a program a I built for my Professor who wanted to create cognitively diverse groups using a set of attributes he collected from a survey.

## Instructions
1. Download the repository.
2. Run dist > interface.exe (takes a couple of seconds to load)
3. Import the Sample Import File.xlsx
4. App will generate the relevant fields from the Excel file
5. Enter the relevant input and hit generate (more info in the PowerPoint)

## Motivation
Group diversity is generally an aspect that is overlooked especially in University projects. As much as I wanted to be with people I'm familiar with, I also meeting new people. Problem is that as much as professors have good intentions to try and diversify groups, it is often done at a rather superficial level. Either by race, ethnicity, nationality, faculty and gender. But when it comes down to getting real work done, what we need is cognitive diversity. The program I built helps to suggest possible groupings by running through iterations of possible groupings and assigning a diversity score. Not only will it save time for professors to group students, it may improve the cognitive diversity of the groups as well. 

## Other Use
Although the primary use of the app is mainly for diversifying groups. There may be other possible ways of using this program for diversification.
